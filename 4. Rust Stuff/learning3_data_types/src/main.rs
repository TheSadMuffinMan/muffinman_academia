/*
PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES: the basic or fundamental data tyes used to declare a variable.
    There are two types of data in Rust: SCALAR and COMPOUND types.
SCALAR DATA TYPE: data that has a finite set of possible values, meaning that each value can be compared to
    any other values as either =, <, or >.
    Examples include integers, floating-point values, booleans, and chars.
COMPOUND DATA TYPE: any data type which can be constructed in a program using the programming language's
    primitive data types and other composite types.
    Examples include arrays and touples.
