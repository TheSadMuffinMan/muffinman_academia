CALLING FUNCTIONS NOTES
    return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
        Body of function
        whatever you want the function to do
    }
        Return_type: A function may return a value. The return type is the data type of the value
        the function returns. Some functions perform operations without returning a value
        (voids). When determining the return type, simply ask yourself "What do I need back from this
        function?" and make that your type.

        Function_name: This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter
        list together constitute the function signature. To call a function, its name is used.

        Parameter_list: the values that the function itself will be using.

        The reason you have to put the function before main is because the function has to be pre-defined.
