Position, Name, Survey Information, Survey Analysis/n
1, Big 5 Survey, Highest: Conscientiousness Lowest: Emotional Stability, This test came as no surprise, and I feel it is accurate.\n
2, Which Character?, 87% match with Jerry Seinfield?, Felt this one was dumb. The "lower" levels matched, but the upper levels were not close.\n
3, Firstborn Quiz, Scored 60 / 100, Average firstborn score was 53.5, so my results corroborate their findings.\n
4, Analog to Multiple Braodband Inventories (AMBI), Lots of data, see Speaking Book, Life is pain Jerry\n
5, Jungian Personality Tests, Personality Type: ESTJ, Extrovert > Introvert Sensing>Intuition Thinking>Feeling Judging>Perceiving\n
6, Open Ennegram of Personality Scales, Type 8 was the highest, I spent the least amount of time on this one. T5 was second, and T3/T1 were tied for third.\n
7, Zodiac-Sign Associated Personality Scales, ***I am a Cancer***, It predicted I am a Virgo. Capricorn second, Cancer/Aquarius tied for third. This was surprisingly accurate seeing as how I don't buy into Astrology.\n
8, Woodworth Psychoneurotic Inventory, Scored 19/116, This is fairly average of modern times. I would have been labelled "unstable" in the 1900's :D\n
