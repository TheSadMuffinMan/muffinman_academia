QUESTION 1:
Given a sequence of input pairs that causes the weighted Q-U algorithm with path compression by halving
    (Program 1.4) to produce a path of length 4.

QUESTION 2:
Modify the program to generate random pairs of integers between 0 and (N-1) instead of ready them from standard input,
    and to loop until N-1 union operations have been formed. Run your program for for N = (10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6) and
    print out the total number of edges generated for each value of N.

QUESTION 3:
Show that Property 1.3 holds for the algorithm described in Exercise 1.20.
