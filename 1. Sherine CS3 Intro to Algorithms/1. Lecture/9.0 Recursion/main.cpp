/*
Recursion is just a function that calls itsself. This is advantageous for solving large problems that have
    many smaller parts that need to be solved. The function executes until it reaches its BASE CASE.

What is Recursion?
    When something is specified in terms of itself.

Why learn Recursion?
    Represents a new mode of thinking.
    Provies a powerful programming paradigm.
    Enables reasoning about correctness.
    Gives insight into the nature of computation.

Many computational artifacts are naturally self-referential.
    File systems wiht folders containing folders.
    Fractal graphical patterns.
    Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms (stay tuned :D).
