/*
If we allow multiple links to a node as well as from a node, the resulting data structure is called a GRAPH.

A graph can be DIRECTED or UNDIRECTED.
    DIRECTED: A graph in which each edge may only be traversed in a specific direction.
    UNDIRECTED: Can navigate in any order.

A graph can be be CONNECTED if you can get from any node to any other node by following edges.
A Directed graph is strongly connected if you can get from any node to any other node by following
    directed edges.

A graph in which no paths exists from one node back to itself except by retracing one's steps is called
    an ACYCLIC graph.

A graph which can be drawn on a sheet of paper with no crossing edges is called a PLANAR graph.

A graph in which all nodes are connected are called a COMPLETE graph.
