/*
As a programmer, you will need to "wear" plenty of hats.
    For example, a programmer/student may need to...
        - Develop a working solution.
        - Solve a problem efficiently for a client.
        - Understand a problem for a theoretician (using the scientific method).

Running Time Analysis:
    We care because making this analysis allows us to make more efficient and better decisions in general.
    Examples include...
        The Discrete Fourier transform - break down waveform of N samples into periodic components.
        N-body simulation - Simulates gravitational interactions among N bodies.

THE CHALLENGE/QUESTION:
    Will my program be able to solve a large practical input?
        Yes, we will use the scientific method to understand performance.
