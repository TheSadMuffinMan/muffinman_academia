/*
DIRECTED GRAPHS (Digraphs): A set of vertices connected pairwise by DIRECTED edges.
    Directed Edges: A "one way street" type of connection.

Outdegree: The amount of outbound connections each node vertice has.
Indegree: The amound of inbound connections each vertice has.
*/

/*
Digraph Problems:
    Path - Is there a directed path from s to t?
    Shortest Path - What is the shortest directed path from s to t?
    Topological Sort - Can you draw a digraph so that all edges point upwards?
    Strong Connectivity - Is there a directed path between all pairs of vertices?
    Transitive Closure - For which vertices v and w is there a path from v to w?

How many different digraphs are there on V vertices?
