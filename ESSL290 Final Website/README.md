# Free Speech Concepts for Programmers

This website was primarily built because I wanted to dip my toes into the realm of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets.
    I have only ever learned about these languages, so it was nice to gain some practical skills regarding HTML and CSSs.

## Opening the Website
If you are one of my professors, you are in luck! I have attached a .zip file (which contains all of these files) in the D2L dropbox.  \
**If you have access to the .zip file...**
1. Unzip the file by right clicking it and selecting `Unzip`. Save the unzipped file to a location where you can find it (Downloads folder is a good place).
2. Open Mozilla Firefox. Other browsers will work, but Firefox has the best tools for interacting with the provided CSS and making the site look pretty.
3. Press `CTRL` + `O` at the same time. This will open the "Open File" screen.
4. Find your saved and unzipped file, open it, and then open the `index.html` file. It is located in the main folder (you don't need to navigate subfolders).
5. Voila! The website should open on your browser.

**If you do not have access to the .zip file...**
1. Download all files and place them into a location that you will remember (Downloads folder or Desktop are both good places). We are more or less creating our own unzipped copy of the aforementioned .zip file.
- Ensure the file structure looks like this:
  - index.html
  - style.css
  - cmu_logo.png
  - concepts (*Folder containing 3 more HTML files*)
- The order of these files does not matter, but they all need to be there for the website to work properly.
2. Now that we have created a local copy of the website, we can refer back to the previous steps (**If you have access to the .zip file...** Step 2: Open Mozilla Firefox). The process for opening the site is the exact same.
3. Press `CTRL` + `O` at the same time.
4. Navigate to saved folder with HTML documents inside it, open the `index.html` file with Firefox.
