This website was primarily built because I wanted to dip my toes into the realm of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets.
    I have only ever learned about these languages, so it was nice to gain some practical skills regarding HTML and CSSs.

If you are looking to launch this website, download all files and place them inside a folder on your computer.
    Ensure the file structure looks like this:
        index.html
        style.css
        cmu_logo.png
        concepts (**Folder containing 3 HTML files**)
    Order does not matter, and the extra.txt file is not needed for website compiliation.
