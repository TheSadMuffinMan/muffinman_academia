    <!-- HTML does not provide many styling options, but that's where the CSS comes in and saves the day by providing a Style Sheet - hence 
        their name (Cascading Style Sheets). CSSs are logic/constraint languages, meaning that they can't do much on their own, but when
        describing/constraining other code (like HTML), it works wonders! -->

    <h1>Free Speech & Civility Concepts for Programmers</h1>
    <h2>Why this artifact was built</h2>
    <p>This website was primarily built because I wanted to dip my toes into the realm of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets. I am enrolled in
        a Free Speech and Civility Milestone Class, and we have been tasked with creating an artifact that is relevant to our studies.
        With this in mind, I built this website to bring together everything I've learned this semester and show how it applies to programmers.
        Additionally, I built this artifact as a potential resumé item which demonstrates my capabilities of working with unfamiliar programming 
        languages.
