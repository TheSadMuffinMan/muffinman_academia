    <h1>Free Speech & Civility Concepts for Programmers</h1>
    <h2>Why this website was built</h2>
    <p>This website was primarily built because I wanted to dip my toes into the realm of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets. I am enrolled in
        a Free Speech and Civility Milestone Class, and we have been tasked with creating an artifact that is relevant to our studies.
        With this in mind, I built this website to bring together everything I've learned this semester and show how it applies to programmers.
        Additionally, I built this artifact as a potential resumé item which demonstrates my capabilities of working with unfamiliar programming 
        languages.
