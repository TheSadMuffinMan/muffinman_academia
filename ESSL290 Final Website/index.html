HTML is weird... When writing, we're only aiming to provide the raw data to the browser. It is up to the CSS to make the page
    pretty and interactable.
If you're planning on sharing elements across different pages, wrap said elements in a class so that the CSS file can apply it's
    constraints across multiple HTML files.

        describing/constraining other code (like HTML), it works wonders! -->

        <h1>Why this artifact was built</h1>
        </div>
    
    <p>This website was primarily built because I wanted to dip my toes into the realm of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets. I am enrolled in
        a Free Speech and Civility Milestone Class, and we have been tasked with creating an artifact that is relevant to our studies.
        With this in mind, I built this website to bring together everything I've learned this semester and show how it applies to programmers.
        Additionally, I built this artifact as a potential resumé item which demonstrates my capabilities of working with unfamiliar programming 
        languages.
