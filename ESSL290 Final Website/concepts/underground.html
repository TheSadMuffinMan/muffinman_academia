        <h1>Censorship forces the conversation to take place underground.</h1>
    </div>

    <p>This point follows closely from the previous one: censorship does not eliminate objectionable ideas. Instead, it drives them to other platforms
        where they continue to circulate without oversight or constructive challenges. In a different virtual Q&A, our class interviewed 
        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Lukianoff" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Greg Lukianoff</a>, current President
        of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE).
    </p>

    <p>Greg warned us of the dangers of echo chambers and how divisive they can be in our communities. We discussed how political messages are being
        sent through government agencies and how it is allowed (no matter how mind blowing it may be). The only solution to all of the problems we
        discussed was through open and honest discussion.
