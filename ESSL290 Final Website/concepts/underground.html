    <p>This point follows closely from the previous one: censorship does not eliminate objectionable ideas. Instead, it drives them to other platforms
        where they continue to circulate without oversight or constructive challenges. For the programmers out there, here's a great analogy: when a
        conversation is censored, it is not terminated. The conversation is instead forked and hosted on less regulated platforms.</p>
