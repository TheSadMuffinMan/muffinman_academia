    <h3>Explain why the message you chose to communicate about free speech matters to you.</h3>
    <p>The message I chose, the three main lessons, are the most important things I learned this semester in this class. I have observed too many cases of
        discussions falling apart when people stop engaging with ideas and instead try to silence them. Censoring affects how people learn, argue, and solve
        problems in everyday life. I genuinely believe that allowing open discussion, even when something is uncomfortable or offensive, leads to better
        long-term understanding and healthier communities.
    </p>

    <h3>Identify your target audience then explain why you believe they would benefit from your message. How might your message inspire and/or empower this
        specific audience?</h3>
    <p>I can attest to the notion that programmers don't often think about how much our profession affects Free Speech. Programmers benefit from my message
        because we are the ones shaping the future of technology, and we're the ones who build the platforms that the majority of people get their news from.
    </p>

    <h3>Explain how the artifact you chose demonstrates and/or showcases your specific skill set and/or talent.</h3>
    <p>The primary reason that I built this artifact was because it provided a unique opportunity for me to do something I had never done before. I have also
        been enrolled in CSCI:330 Programming Languages Class this semester, and we spent a decent amount of time learning about HTML and CSS. This project was
        the perfect storm of ideas, with my computer science studies integrating perfectly with my Free Speech studies. The artifact shows that I can translate
        course concepts into a format that makes sense to other programmers or technical learners, which is a skill I'm extremely proud of.
    </p>

    <h3>Explain how and why the artifact you chose will resonate with your target audience.</h3>
    <p>I think my artifact will resonate with the target audience because it's designed by someone who understands how they think. Instead of preaching or being
        overly political, my website frames the discussion in a practical, tech-oriented way that programmers can relate to.
    </p>

    <h3>Explain how research and/or course content informed your final project.</h3>
    <p>Although I did not do much explicit research for this project, I used course content for all the content inside of the website. I referenced our virtual
        Q&A sessions with Dr. Strossen, President Marshall, and Greg Lukianoff as authoritative/expert figures. Without my professors' organization of these
        sessions, I would not have had the content to share with programmers.
