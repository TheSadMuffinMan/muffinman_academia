        <h1>Deplatforming and censorship are becoming the new norm.</h1>
        </div>

    <p>Deplatforming is becoming more normalized across both political parties. This is worrisome because mass deplatforming goes against the very fabric
        that this country was built apon: the ability the speak freely and criticize the government.
    </p>
    
    <p>In our class discussions, we talked about how removing a voice doesn't make the underlying belief disappear. If anything, it strengthens the narrative
        that certain groups are being “silenced,” which only fuels resentment and pushes communities deeper into isolated corners of the internet. President
        Marshall and I both theorize that this is exactly what Jared Taylor was after when he came and spoke on campus. He didn't have anything unique to say,
        he wanted to be cancelled. If he had received that reaction, he could share with his audience that his message is "so dangerous that it isn't even
        allowed on college campuses".
