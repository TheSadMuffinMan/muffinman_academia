    <p>This concept was the most important one driven home by my professors, Dr. Christi Hein and Professor Alana Voth. On November 4 2025, our class
        was provided the oppurtunity to have a virtual Q&A with <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Strossen" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener 
        noreferrer">Dr. Nadine Strossen</a> (previous President of the American Civil Liberities Union). In that Q&A, we started by defining the concept of
        offense as something that is entirely subjective. We agreed that what one person finds offensive another might see as valuable, humorous, or necessary
        criticisms. So, in such a diverse and complex world, we must be careful to not place limitations on free speech just due to personal offense. If we do
        place such constraints on speech, then we are setting a dangerous precedent where the loudest or most sensitive group can silence everyone else.
