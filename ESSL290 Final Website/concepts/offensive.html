    <p>This concept was the most important one driven home by my professors, Dr. Christi Hein and Professor Alana Voth. This idea may seem like a no brainer,
        but the trickiness of subject was highlighted after our case study of <a href =
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Skokie, Illinois 
        (1977)</a>. In summary, a group of individuals attempted to dress in full Nazi memorabilia and march through the Jewish community of Skokie, IL. The village
        and state did everything in their power to stop the march, but utlimately the supreme court ruled favor of the National Socialist Party. They were represented
        by the ACLU, and on November 4 2025, our class was provided the oppurtunity to have a virtual Q&A with <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Strossen"
        target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Dr. Nadine Strossen</a> (previous President of the American Civil Liberities Union). In that Q&A, we started by
        defining the concept of offense as something that is entirely subjective. We agreed that what one person finds offensive another might see as valuable,
        humorous, or necessary criticisms. So, in such a diverse and complex world, we must be careful to not place limitations on free speech just due to personal
        offense. If we do place such constraints on speech, then we are setting a dangerous precedent where the loudest or most sensitive group can silence everyone
        else.
