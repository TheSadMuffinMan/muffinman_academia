7/26/24 working on

TASK:
    Tim is an absolutely obsessive soda drinker, he simply cannot get enough. Most annoyingly though, he almost never has
        any money, so his only obvious legal way to obtain more soda is to take the money he gets when he recycles empty
        soda bottles to buy new ones. In addition to the empty bottles resulting from his own consumption he sometimes
        find empty bottles in the street. One day he was extra thirsty, so he actually drank sodas until he couldn’t
        afford a new one.

INPUT:
    Three non-negative integers "e" "f" & "c", where e(<1000) == the number of empty soda bottles in Tim’s possession at
        the start of the day, f(<1000) == the number of empty soda bottles found during the day, and (2 <= c < 2000) c ==
        the number of empty bottles required to buy a new soda.
    Example 1:
9 0 3

    Example 2:
5 5 2

OUTPUT:
    How many sodas did Tim drink on his extra thirsty day?

    Example 1:
    4

    Example 2:
    9
