7/11/24 Skipping. Way more difficult than I imagined.

TASK:
    Your task will be to write a program for reversing numbers in binary. For instance, the binary
        representation of 13 is 1101, and reversing it gives 1011, which corresponds to number 11.

INPUT:
    The input contains a single line with an integer N(1 <= N <= 1,000,000,000).

OUTPUT:
    Output one line with one integer, the number we get by reversing the binary representation of N.
