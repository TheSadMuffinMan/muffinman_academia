TASK:
    Alex wants to send a love poem to his girlfriend Bridget. Unfortunately, she has a nosy friend, Ellen, who might intercept
        his message and invade their privacy.

    To prevent this, Alex has invented a scheme to make his missives indecipherable to Ellen. He arranges the letters into a
        square, which is rotated a quarter-turn clockwise, and then he puts the resulting letters on a single line again. (For
        simplicity’s sake, Alex doesn’t use whitespace or punctuation in his poems.)

    For example, the text “RosesAreRedVioletsAreBlue” would be encoded as
        “eedARBtVrolsiesuAoReerles”.
    
    Ellen has intercepted some of Alex’s messages but they make no sense to her. Can you write a program to help her decode 
        them?

INPUT:
    On the first line one positive number: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:
        one line with an encoded message: a string consisting of upper-case and lower-case letters only. The length of the
        message is a square between 1 and 10 000 characters.
    
    Example 1:

eedARBtVrolsiesuAoReerles
EarSvyeqeBsuneMa

OUTPUT:
    One line with the original message.
