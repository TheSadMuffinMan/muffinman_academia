TASK:
    For this problem you will compute various running sums of values for positive integers.

INPUT:
    The first line of input contains a single integer 'P' (1 <= P <= 10,000), which is the number of data sets that
        follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently. Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, 'K', followed by an integer 'N', (1 <= N <= 10,000).
    
    Example 1:
3
1 1
2 10
3 1001

OUTPUT:
    For each data set there is one line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number 'K', followed by
        a single space followed by three space separated integers S[1], S[2], and S[3], and such that:
            - S[1] = The sum of the first 'N' positive integers.
            - S[2] = The sum of the first 'N' odd integers.
            - S[3] = The sum of the first 'N' even integers.

    Example 1:
1 1 1 2
2 55 100 110
3 501501 1002001 1003002
