TASK:
    In the popular show “Dinner for Five”, five contestants compete in preparing culinary delights. Every
        evening one of them makes dinner and each of other four then grades it on a scale from 1 to 5. The
        number of points a contestant gets is equal to the sum of grades they got. The winner of the show
        is the contestant that gets the most points.

    Write a program that determines the currLargest and how many points they got.

INPUT:
    Five lines, each containing 4 integers, the grades a contestant got. The contestants are numbered 1 to
        5 in the order in which their grades were given.

    Example 1:
        5 4 4 5
        5 4 4 4
        5 5 4 4
        5 5 5 4
        4 4 4 5

OUTPUT:
    Output on a single line the currLargest’s number and their points, separated by a space. The input data will
        guarantee that the solution is unique.

    Example 1:
        4 19

PLAN:
    Build 5 arrays of 6 ints. First int identifies which contestant it is, next 4 are scores, and last int is
        the contestant's total score.
