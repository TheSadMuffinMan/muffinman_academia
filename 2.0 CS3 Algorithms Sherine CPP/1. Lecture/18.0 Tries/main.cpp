/*
TRIES DATA STRUCTURE:
• Very useful for large string data sets.
• Get's its name from the word "retrieval", but is pronounced "try"s.
• Fundamentally, a Trie stores each char (inside of a string) as a node in a tree.
    - This allows us to be extremely space and time efficient, as we do not have any wasted space and
    the search operation traverses the tree very quickly.
