/* HASH TABLES:
Hash Tables' goals are to increase time efficiency greater than our standard logarithmic time.
One down side of a Hash Table is their size: they take up a lot of memory!

Hashing basic plan:
- HASH FUNCTION: Method for computing array index from key.
- Scramble the keys uniformly to produce a table index.

Linear Probing:
- Results in less wasted space and better cache performance.

Seperate Chaining:
- Performance degardes gracefully.
- Clustering less sensitive to poorly-designed hash function.
